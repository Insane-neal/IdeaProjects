ELM-java
========

The Java version of basic Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

This library is free software;
 * The original version is a matlab code,I rewrote it in Java.
 * The original Authors: MR QIN-YU ZHU AND DR GUANG-BIN HUANG,
 * The original WEBSITE: http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/elm_codes.html.

You need to add mtj-0.9.14 and netlib-java-0.9.3 in the path.

This code was completed in July, 2012. It has not been rigorously tested. And the implemention is to be optimized.
